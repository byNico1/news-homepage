## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned a lot about css positioning I really have many things to improve about that, and I think my code could still improve a lot but still I am learning and learned a lot as putting my knowladge into practice, I learned some things about javascript that I already knew but as I didnt put it into practice I kind of forgot some things.

```css
.nav-item + .nav-item {
  margin-left: 1em;
}
.left-section {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: flex-start;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 30px;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.cols-2-container {
  max-width: 1110px;
  gap: 30px;
  width: 90%;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to improve on using better class names like using BEM it's just sometimes I don't know if it's completely useful and sometimes i get confuse about it but I do really want to implement it
